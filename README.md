# Spells-Finder
Website developed for class [*Distributed Databases* **(8INF803)**](http://cours.uqac.ca/8INF803) at [UQAC](https://uqac.ca) (QC, CA).

The main objective is to use the MapReduce algorithm on a database (containing spells) to filter them and find the right one.

# Getting started
Once you have pull the project, you first have to launch the server.
You have to open a windows terminal and enter the following command :

`node server.js`

The server will be ready to receive clients requests. To do so, go to your favorite browser and visit *localhost:8080* webpage.

Don't forget to, sometimes, check the server console which will be printed inside the terminal. Every time you refresh the webpage a new client request will be made to the server.

Right now, the server doesn't update himself when you made changes. You have to manually restart the server to take in account your changes.
